# Resploit- Understanding Telecom networks and analyzing the security of core networks in a telecom¬†deployment
Resploit is a GUI-based penetration testing toolkit tailored for analyzing, auditing, and securing telecom core networks. Built using Python and PyQt5, it provides an intuitive interface that integrates seamlessly with powerful security tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, and more.
Rather than serving as a generic network scanner, Resploit is crafted to assist researchers, red teamers, and telecom professionals in assessing vulnerabilities specific to telecom deployments‚Äîparticularly in 5G/4G core network environments.

# üõ∞Ô∏è Resploit - Telecom Network Pentesting Toolkit

**Resploit** is a telecom network penetration testing toolkit designed for evaluating the security posture of modern 5G core networks. Built using real-world telecom stacks like [Free5GC](https://www.free5gc.org/), this project simulates and tests vulnerabilities in the Next Generation Core (NGC) through crafted attack modules, custom analysis tools, and live demos. It aims to empower researchers, telecom engineers, and security enthusiasts with better understanding and control over 5G deployments.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reinfosec-Resploit/Resploit.git
cd Resploit
```

### 2. Setup Free5GC Core

Ensure Docker and Golang are installed. Then follow the setup script:

```bash
cd core
./run.sh
```

This launches the AMF, SMF, UPF, NRF, AUSF, and web UI at:

- Web Console: http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://<your_ip>:5000

### 3. Run Recon/Pentest Modules

```bash
cd recon
python3 ngap_scan.py --target 192.168.1.35
```
